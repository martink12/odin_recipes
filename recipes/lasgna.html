    <h3>

    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Pasta
        </li>
        <li>
            Sauce
        </li>
        <li>
            Italian Seasoning
        </li>
        <li>
            Ground Beef
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, 
            and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. 
            The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. 
            We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the 
            mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!
        </li>
        <li>
            From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer 
            of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until
             you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!
        </li>
    </ol>
